## Description
- a discord bot that tracks activity of members/students in a private server, using currency system
- users earn currency by chatting and participating in voice chats
- users pay taxes each day to improve motivation to stay active in the server
- admins can specify text channels for currency system and perform currency operations, including un- / freezing user's balance. In this case the user's balance is "immune" to the daily taxes, reports and isn't able to earn the currency. 
- a daily report about the inactive users, whose currency balance equals 0 or less, can be sent in a specified text channel
- the ui is in German

### Tech Stack
- Discord4j
- Project Reactor
- Spring Framework (JDBC)
- PostgreSQL


## What I've learned
- how to interact with Discord API using Project Reactor & Discord4J
- how to perform scheduled tasks in spring
- using a map of beans-interface-imlementations from Spring Application Context to get rid of hardcoding (multiple ifs) and changing the code, in the case when new interface implementations are added to the map

## How to use
- Go to [the discord developer portal]([http://www.example.com](https://discord.com/developers)) register there and get there a discord token for the bot. The bot needs Admin scopes.
- clone the project
- create .env file in the root of the project and configure there environment variables, including the token **WIZARD_TOKEN** based on the docker-compose file in the project. **DATASOURCE_HOST** and **DATASOURCE_PORT** are the database container name and its port in the docker compose file. You can change **services.app** config in the file to use a local **Dockerfile** in the project's directory
- build the project with **gradle :bootJar**
- launch the project with **docker-compose up**
